/**
 * Similar to differentGroups.js--see differentGroups.js for more detail on params etc.
 *
 * Creates groups, tries to ensure that each member of the group has similar properties.
 * Uses functions addFirstToGroup, and addNextToGroup, described below.
 *
 * Returns a nested array in which each inner array is a group of length groupSize, consisting of
 * the students belonging to that group.
 *
 * Creates a pool of students, as the algorithm finds an appropriate student to add to the group
 * it adds the student to the group and removes it from the pool.
 *
 * Adds the first student in the pool to the first group and every time there is a new group,
 * calling addFirstToGroup.
 *
 * After adding the first student to a group, it will look at the properties (priorities) in the
 * existing group members, and search the pool for a student whose properties all match. If it
 * cannot find one, it will remove the lowest priority property (thus why they're called
 * properties) and look in the pool for a student matching all the priorities except the removed
 * last one. If it cannot find a student that matches, it will again remove the lowest priority
 * and search again, and so on. If only the first priority remains and still it does not find a
 * match in the pool, then it eliminates the priorities completely and adds the next student in
 * the pool.
 *
 * If number of students % groupSize !== 0, then the remaining students are added to the last
 * groups to make them slightly larger, as this is generally more favorable than making the
 * last groups smaller. To do this, groupSize is incremented only for these last groups.
